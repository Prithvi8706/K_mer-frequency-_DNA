This file includes the code for showcasing the k-mers of a certain dna sequence which is taken from the below link
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=Homo+sapiens+COX1
this code was originally done in online jupyter notebook but since it doesn't have access to the remote files(the dna-fasta file),I had to do it in google colab.
